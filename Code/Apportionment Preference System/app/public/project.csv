Emma Richards, our founder who is a practicing Optometrist and was seeing preventable eye injuries that can have lasting effects on vision on a very regular basis. Safety Glasses Online is a small privately owned business based on the Sunshine Coast. 
90+% of eye injuries are known to be preventable, by wearing the correct eye protection.  A high proportion of these eye injuries can significantly affect vision and lead to life long consequences.  Such as affecting employment and mobility opportunities. The virtual mirror application will improve confidence when ordering and therefore uptake of eye protection.  
This application fits within the mission statement of significantly reducing the incidence of an accidental eye injury.  By improving the ease and confidence for people selecting and ordering eye protection online.  Our virtual mirror application is significantly different from those currently available as research has demonstrated.","The project's requirements include virtual try-on of spectacles.  To give people a real mirror experience, with the ability to use video and see the sides of the frame on your head in real time.
Overview: We are approaching the development of a mobile-device enabled safety spectacle fitting system through two pathfinding projects: 3D face capture on mobile devices and Fitting 3D spectacle and face models.
Our overarching goal is to develop a system that enables people to find rigid safety spectacles (not goggles) that best fit the contours of their face; the system uses a consumer-grade mobile device (e.g., a mobile phone) to capture a sufficiently accurate 3D model of a personâ€™s face and provide information about the best fit that various rigid spectacles could achieve, allowing the person to find suitable safety spectacles without having to visit a specialised fitting facility â€?something which is a real barrier to safety for people who may be working in rural and remote locations (e.g., on farms, at mine sites). Previous BIT Capstone teams have created an Android app platform, and we want these projects to critically consider and learn from what has been achieved so far. Last years Team will be available to assist with handover to this yearâ€™s teams.

3D face capture on mobile devices is a project whose ultimate aim is to implement software that can use consumer-grade mobile device cameras to capture a 3D model of a personâ€™s face with sufficient accuracy for safety spectacle fitting. At this stage, we see a range of important insights to be gained including: a meaningful understanding of the relevant parameters of popular mobile device camera systems for 3D modelling (i.e., what can different mobile phone cameras capture). What are the strengths and limitations of the hardware and software involved? What data representations are appropriate and what are their pros and cons? How robust (i.e., repeatable, error tolerant) can we make the capture process? How can users get feedback to ensure their face is captured with sufficient accuracy and precision? How can users be guided through the capture process to ensure effective capture? We want these and other questions to be explored and developed using a series of working software prototypes that can be used and extended in future years by subsequent Capstone Teams. You will be working in concert with the Team investigating Fitting 3D spectacle and face models.

Miles Primrose, started working on commercial sites at the age of 23 in a project management role and founded BusinessSight in August 2003, we run the most compressive business program for Trades and Builders in Australia from start-ups to businesses in their tens of millions

Miles has been an ongoing supporter of the youth in the building industry and is a member of NAWIC & AWIC and was nominated for a Male Advocate of change for women in construction 

We all hear of trades and builders having many different issues with their business; lack of direction, lack of business knowledge, team issues, financial, sales, processes and the list goes on.
","THE PROBLEM with a lot of Trades and or Building businesses, young or established, is that they need clearer direction around building their team or how to get to the next stage in their business life. They have enough to think about without having to second guess what they need to do, or am I doing the right thing in the right order.

THE GOAL FOR THIS PROJECT: Is to revolutionise the Trades and Building Sector by creating a â€œAll in one APPâ€?that can help build their team and their business overall.

The primary purpose of this project is to develop an innovative, interactive, and comprehensive â€œAll in One Appâ€? specifically designed for individuals studying, working in the construction space, either be it on the tools, in the office or support services

1.To create a prototype so users have a positive experience by meeting other students that are about to embark on an educational learning journey.
2.To have functionality that allows further development such as improving the profiling detail & business structure tools.

There are 5 features inside the Trades and Building App (T&BA)

A.MY NATURAL STRENGTH (FREE) 
This takes your through a series of 7 multiple choice questions and gathers some basic information about you and your business and or career, the end result is your end up with a report and it explains what your strength is out of one of four strengths and how this relates to the building industry 

B.MY BETTER WEEKLY STRUCTURE (FREE) 
Like most trades, time is becoming a bigger and bigger issue for them - I need more, I'm going crazy, this shows them how to structure their week for growth and personal balance 

The purpose of this is to build something that will enable the end user to work through a series of steps/questions so they end up with a better or ideal weekly structure that is divided up into certain categories across their business and personal life. This will show them when they are ready to hire someone and stop doing certain things themselves 

C.MY NATURAL PROFILE (PAID) 
This is a paid test, this enables them to work out with accuracy, which one of eight profiles they are and what % they are of all of the eight profiles and what role they are best suited to in the building industry. This is displayed as a silhouette of a person in eight different stages each stage so shows a percentage of each profile so they can understand what they are best suited to and what they need to give to others, This is worked out from a series of 36 questions to find out their particular profile.

D.MY NATURAL BUSINESS PROREGRESSION (PAID) 
This is a paid test, this enables them to work out with accuracy, what stage they are at in their business life and what they need to do both personally and professionally to get to the next stage, it will re-enforce that they cannot lie about their position with this test as it will not help them on their journey.

This test has a big focus on building their team, their financials both personal and business and collaboration amongst other things, They will be asked a series of questions, depending on what answers they have given there might be more or less questions, as with the profile above, it will follow the same process.

This section will provide quite a comprehensive report that shows them with accuracy where they are and the steps they need to take to get to the next stage both personally and commercially.

E.MY PURPOSE (PAID) 
This is a paid test, this enables them to work out what their purpose is and has a series of short, animated explainer videos, A lot of the time people go into business for the wrong internal reasons, this will look externally, once we work this out we have a genuine passion and one that can attract other team members that love that too, and it can be beneficial in the community. 

THIS WILL BE A GAME CHANGER FOR THE INDUSTRY, Reducing stress and improving direction.

The school focuses on developing IT solutions to meet the needs of consumers, which is also the goal of this project. A lack of visibility on operations makes the businesses employ unfair pricing policies, exploiting end consumers. By creating more visibility and pointing customers toward cheap service providers, we could influence the pricing policies of businesses, which is the problem this project aims to investigate. There may be opportunities to conduct experiments with consumers to assess the market demand for IT solutions of this nature.","Developing a mobile application that leverages crowdsourcing to help consumers find the most cost-effective shopping options for groceries and household items is an innovative solution to the problem of high living costs. This concept addresses the issue of price disparities across different retailers by creating a community-driven platform where consumers can share and access pricing information. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this project:

Project Planning and Research

Market Research: Conduct research to understand the existing solutions in the market, identify gaps, and determine how your app can offer unique value.
Target Audience Analysis: Define your target audience (low- and middle-income households, students) to tailor the app's features according to their needs.
Feasibility Study: Assess the technical, economic, and legal feasibility of crowdsourcing price data.

App Design and Features
User Interface (UI) Design: Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to upload bills, view prices, and create shopping lists.
Price Database: Develop a robust database to store and manage the price data of various grocery and household items across different stores.
Rewards System: Implement a rewards system where users earn points for uploading bills, which can be exchanged for gift cards or vouchers.
Price Comparison Tool: Create a feature that allows users to compare prices of a specific item across different stores and recommend the cheapest option.
Shopping List Generator: Enable users to generate a budget-friendly shopping list by selecting items from various stores based on the cheapest prices available.

Development
Technology Stack: Choose a suitable technology stack for mobile app development (e.g., Flutter for cross-platform compatibility, Firebase for backend services).
Data Privacy and Security: Ensure the app complies with data protection regulations and implement security measures to protect user data.
Crowdsourcing Mechanism: Develop a system for verifying the authenticity of uploaded bills to prevent fraudulent entries.

Legal and Ethical Considerations
Compliance: Ensure the app complies with all relevant laws and regulations regarding consumer data and privacy.
Ethical Pricing: Promote ethical practices among businesses by highlighting price gouging and encouraging fair pricing.

This project not only has the potential to significantly impact consumers' ability to manage their household expenses but also encourages transparency and fair pricing practices among retailers. By focusing on community engagement and providing tangible rewards for participation, our app can foster a loyal user base and make a meaningful difference in the lives of many.","Prototype, report, video demonstration, user manual/documentation",Weekly or fortnightly catch up via Zoom,"Developing the BargainBin app requires expertise in mobile app development (using languages like Kotlin, Swift, or cross-platform frameworks such as Flutter), backend development (familiarity with Node.js or Python, and database management), along with knowledge in data privacy, security practices, and proficiency in using version control systems like Git.","QUT offers a Project Partner Agreement to our industry partners to manage the requirements around workplace health and safety, intellectual property, confidentiality, indemnity and insurance for work experience arrangements.

31,Talent Insight Solutions,DISC Platform,Client Business Platform,Web development (service/system/site),Web Development,WEDE,NA,NA,NA,"WEDE, NA","Anna and Kylie are the founding partnership of Talent Insight Solutions.  Our business partnership commenced in 2019, but our friendship extends back to high-school. 
We are a family and people focused business and have a passion for empowering women in business.  We have 9 children between us and run a very busy schedule.   We are driven, goal focused, friendly, visual rather than analytical, and are not technically minded (which is why we may need guidance from time to time).  We value communication, honesty and the opportunity to resolve issues as they arise. 
Kylie comes from a corporate and small business background and is at the top of her field as one of only 10 Extended DISC Master Trainers in Australia. Thereâ€™s nothing she wonâ€™t help you to do that she hasnâ€™t done herself â€?from leading teams of staff to refining sales strategies, uncovering human behaviours and motivations, and improving skills through training.   
Dr Anna Blackman has an outstanding academic background. Over the last two decades, Anna has extensively studied, taught and published in her areas of expertise - business coaching, human resources and business management, plus rural and regional leadership. Online teaching and learning, as part and parcel of modern university life, is also one of Annaâ€™s specialties.   
We pride ourselves on being partners people can trust to understand their organisationâ€™s needs and deliver a solution in a way that surprises, delights and produces real-world results. Our organisation brings together evidence-based research and business experience in start-ups and corporate environments.
We use science-backed tests and assessments to produce real data that forms the basis of our recommendations and insights. Make â€˜people decisionsâ€?with confidence, knowing people have the data evidence to back their instinct and help shape and clarify the way forward. Our profiling tools include Extended DISC and Social + Emotional Intelligence profiles. 
Our services include - Coaching, Training, Professional Development, Extended DISC Certification, Psychometric Assessments, Surveys, Sport and Athlete competence assessments.  We service all stages of an organisationâ€™s HR life cycle from recruitment, team and leadership development, organisational climate and culture analysis and improvement.
View more about us on our website - https://talentinsightsolutions.com/our-story/
Over the years, we have identified that there is a need in the market for a platform to collect, manage, communicate and develop people in a more effective and efficient way by understanding people data.  We have identified missing gaps in the marketplace and developed our concept for a platform to combine people skills and individual behavioural data to improve individual and organisational performance, management, engagement and culture.  As a society, we analyse data for systems improvement. Organisations engage people for psychometric assessments, training and coaching. But, where does the information go? How does the organisation access this for ongoing analysis? How do you map individual development? We would like to create a unique centralised website user interface that is user friendly and interactive for people to access and manage their people data.  
We have years of experience in business, coaching and people to support us to develop a people focused data solution.  As Kylie is only one of 10 Master Trainers of Extended DISC in Australia, we have the opportunity to use the API integration to obtain the individual behavioural data from the FinxS Extended DISC reporting tool.  This science backed data would enable people mapping within an organisation in a visual interface with the ability to include additional data for a human centric platform.  Organisational benefits include: reduced recruitment, onboarding and retention costs; improved human resource management for training and development; improved leadership scope and an ability to see an entire organisation in one platform from a human centric people perspective.
This platform would be accessible to businesses and our consultants to purchase and use in partnership with their existing business operations for HR and Management.  Our consultants would be able to use this as part of their own business when working with clients.  This would provide our business with a unique selling point and value add for our clients and consultants. 
","During 2023, we worked on Stage 1 of our project with QUT students who have built a prototype platform for clients to view results of their Extended DISC Reports, manage data and their people.  The aim of the website platform is for Organisations (HR/Consultants, Business) to be able to have an individual login. The platform will be designed with separate market segments (as mentioned above) with one overarching interface.
The website platform pulls the API from FinxS currently for one type of report into a user-friendly platform.  Users can access results and content from their profile.  Currently the API can successfully receive reports via API and a goal would be to further develop this.
We would like applicants to use modern applications for intuitivity, creativity/design and ease of use.

This project is to test a concept for a new development that will engage students in developing a potentially lifesaving tool.,"Throughout 2024, the project team will be guided through the process of prototyping a conceptual digital tool through various stages, presenting a low-resolution prototype with a clear articulation of the systems and languages required and then developing a working medium-resolution prototype. The project, in particular, connects a mobile phone app, a hypothetical telephony service/s and other devices. The concept, in particular, aims to support emergency response processes to help mediate a gap that could save human life and reduce the economic impact, which is currently in the realm of about $63B. 
 
â€?Students will be asked to assign intellectual property rights for the work to A Fullon Enterprise; however students will have the right to communicate their participation in this project as a part of their portfolio of works per the regular IP assignment of QUT. 
â€?Students will be asked to limit formal public communication about the project (i.e. not discussing trade secrets by social media); however we understand that it is normal for people to share their excitement about what theyâ€™re working on with friends, family and colleagues. 
â€?Sudden Cardiac Death costs the Australian economy $51.2 Billion per year, only 10% of out-of-hospital CPR attempts are successful and so 88% of sudden cardiac arrests result in death. 
â€?50% of the Australian population are trained in CPR, yet only 40% of people who experience sudden cardiac arrest receive CPR. 
â€?The goal here is to develop a process facilitated through a mobile phone application that saves lives. If our process can improve survivability by just 1% of the total number of people who actually receive CPR then this could save 132 lives and save the hospital system and economy in the realms of $200 million each year. Imagine the possibility if we not only improved survivability but also empowered a community of people who are not formally trained in CPR to reduce the gap of those who do not receive CPR.    
â€?We are seeking a motivated team of students to work with us throughout their capstone project to participate in the development of this service, iterating it over the year through the stages of minimum-viable-product, ready for alpha testing, ready for beta testing and industry-ready. 
â€?Students will work closely with an experienced founder and learn the skills required to be leading entrepreneurs. Students will learn about the importance of taking their coding expertise and emboldening it with rigorous project planning, project management, testing and deployment protocols.

OreFox offers scalable, AI-enabled, user-centric solutions that promise to redefine efficiency and decision-making in processes.","The project involves developing a farm data management system using Django for the web application and an Android app for mobile user interaction. Key features include offline data entry on the Android app and automatic synchronisation with the Django backend once internet connectivity is restored. This system will manage various farm-related data through Django models and RESTful APIs for seamless data exchange.

Testing and deployment considerations focus on reliability and scalability.
","Creating a website for farm management using Django, along with an accompanying Android app that allows for offline data entry and synchronisation when internet access is available, involves several key components and considerations. This approach leverages Django's robust web development framework for the server-side application and a mobile app developed for Android that can handle offline data storage and later synchronise with the Django backend.

Emma Richards, our founder who is a practicing Optometrist and was seeing preventable eye injuries that can have lasting effects on vision on a very regular basis. Safety Glasses Online is a small privately owned business based on the Sunshine Coast. 
90+% of eye injuries are known to be preventable, by wearing the correct eye protection.  A high proportion of these eye injuries can significantly affect vision and lead to life long consequences.  Such as affecting employment and mobility opportunities. The virtual mirror application will improve confidence when ordering and therefore uptake of eye protection.  
This application fits within the mission statement of significantly reducing the incidence of an accidental eye injury.  By improving the ease and confidence for people selecting and ordering eye protection online.  Our virtual mirror application is significantly different from those currently available as research has demonstrated.","We are approaching the development of a mobile-device enabled safety spectacle fitting system through two pathfinding projects: 3D face capture on mobile devices and Fitting 3D spectacle and face models.
Our overarching goal is to develop a system that enables people to find rigid safety spectacles (not goggles) that best fit the contours of their face; the system uses a consumer-grade mobile device (e.g., a mobile phone) to capture a sufficiently accurate 3D model of a personâ€™s face and provide information about the best fit that various rigid spectacles could achieve, allowing the person to find suitable safety spectacles without having to visit a specialised fitting facility â€?something which is a real barrier to safety for people who may be working in rural and remote locations (e.g., on farms, at mine sites). Previous BIT Capstone teams have created an Android app platform, and we want these projects to critically consider and learn from what has been achieved so far. Last yearâ€™s Team will be available to assist with handover to this yearâ€™s teams.

Fitting 3D spectacle and face models is a project whose ultimate aim is to implement software that can find the â€œbestâ€?fit between a 3D model of a face and a 3D model of a pair of safety spectacles; this software would serve as the basis for determining the â€œbestâ€?fits between a 3D model of a face and a variety of 3D spectacle models and to be incorporated in the overall fitting system. We put the word â€œbestâ€?in quotes because there is more than one dimension of fit to consider, and there will be be multiple equally well-fitting configurations within tolerance. At this stage, we see a range of important insights to be gained including: how has this kind of problem been solved already (i.e., a literature search to establish relevant prior knowledge across different application domains, e.g., drug design, where there is a need to evaluate the 3D fit between molecules)? How can the problem be simplified by applying reasonable constraints (e.g., on orientation and feasible fitting configurations, such as requiring symmetry about the facial mid-line)? How can fit (or lack of fit) be meaningful represented and visualised? How could fitting incorporate non-rigidity, i.e., a level of deformation in the spectacle-wearerâ€™s skin? You will be working in concert with the Team investigating 3D face capture on mobile devices.

In this project, the team will design a game/puzzle that is equivalent to a mathematical problem we are researching here at CSIRO. This integrates into our research as a way to collect high-quality data that can be used to train machine learning models to solve the same problem.
 
Specifically, the problem consists of a process model and a set of properties it must comply with, but the model is â€˜messed-upâ€?and not satisfying all properties. The problem is solved by changing some variables such that the required properties are achieved. However, brute force approaches to solving this are problematic as one change may fix the original broken property but unintentionally cause another required property to break. Humans are much more capable of comprehending all features of the problem at once and finding an intuitive solution, and so we want to leverage this in training our machine learning model. The components of the problem can be abstracted to fit whatever context, and a larger game/puzzle can be built on top, so long as playerâ€™s solution can be deciphered back to a solution that fits the original problem.

The underlying mathematical problem is highly theoretical, and students will need to deeply understand it. Technical skills that would help are:
- Basic graph theory
- Logic

- Game mechanics
- Bisimulation
- Game design experience

With a head office in Sydney and customers in the UK, the BigPicture technology enables multi-use, accessible data systems by creating an atomic data layer that collects, stores and re-presents clinical data. It is a foundational and reusable interface which can be easily deployed across different specialties, care stages, and care locations, allowing providers to truly modernise the entire healthcare value chain & patient journey.","A knowledge graph is a highly connected data space that represents information entities and highlights the relationships between these entities. The knowledge graph can easily be traversed to find and expose complex relationships across disparate entities. In the healthcare sector, the data about patients and their encounters with care providers are created across many distributed clinical systems. Bringing all this data together requires an innovative information platform to address the complexity in data relationships and the advanced semantic relationships. The goal of this project is to demonstrate that knowledge graphs will provide significant advances for both the healthcare provider and consumer.

The project will investigate the state-of-the-art in respect to knowledge graphs used in healthcare, and similar safety-driven domains, where semantic interoperability is a critical capability. This will cover the technologies that enable the use of ontologies and vocabularies (such as the W3C Semantic Web RDF, OWL, and SKOS specifications). This will underpin the information models required (which will be based on  HL7 and OpenEHR specifications) to develop an overarching ontology for the healthcare knowledge domain including supporting reasoning outcomes. In addition, healthcare information has strong conformance requirements, such as the use of mandatory properties and vocabulary terms, which are normative rules defined by ""shape"" expressions (such as the W3C SHACL specification). Finally, a knowledge graph needs a robust interface for data queries and updates (such as the W3C SPARQL specification and GraphQL) as well as supporting graph analytics to support advanced reports and insights.

The project will demonstrate the above capabilities by establishing a semantic knowledge graph (cloud-based) platform (from a leading vendor) and development of a base healthcare ontology. The platform will also demonstrate common use cases that can showcase this emerging technology and its benefits to the healthcare ecosystem.

This project will require students that would fulfill these Personas:
- Business Analyst - responsible for the requirements and use cases (Agile, Sprints)
- Ontology Developer - responsible for the development of the base healthcare ontology and supporting vocabularies (RDF, OWL, SKOS, PROV, HL7 FHIR, OpenEHR, Protege)

Rather than manufacturing in Brisbane and shipping Australia-wide, we have signed manufacturers across the country so that screens can be manufactured locally, eliminating lengthy transportation journeys, in turn having a significant positive impact on our environmental footprint. Manufacturers will promote our designs on their own site, allowing customers to purchase directly from the manufacturer. 

Problem: How do we track the projects which are being sent to our new licensed manufacturers to ensure they are being quoted in a timely manner, track which projects are converted into sales, report square meters sold at the end of each month, and provide support to our manufacturers based on the data collected.

Solution: Develop a backend CRM system which will be the user hub for our manufacturers. It will also allow us to track which projects they have quoted, success rate/converted to sales, square meters sold. From this, we can produce monthly reports for data analysis and invoicing. Each manufacturer will also have the ability to drag and drop images of completed projects into a gallery which links to their page on our website. 

Notes:
Projects Quoted : this will link to our quotation form on our website. Prompts the manufacturer if they have not responded within 48 hours. Prompts again every 24 hours.

Teaching and research are our core business. This project aims to enable an aspect of teaching that can arise from time to time in many units: gathering student preference information.,"The aim of this project is to explore how preference information could be gathered, and evaluate the strengths and limitations of a range of approaches. In this context, preference information refers to preferences that different people express for different items when there are limits on the number of items available. For example, in the current IT Capstone Unit (IFB398) we want to enable different teams of students to express preferences to be assigned to different Capstone Projects, and we want to limit the number of teams that can express a preference for any given project to help ensure collective preferences are well spread across all projects.

This preferincing problem occurs in other contexts, e.g., sales and inventory management, event ticketing.

Being able to use voice as an input mechanism will allow for more accurate live-coding of games as coders will no longer need to look down when coding. This dramatically decreases the errors that coders are likely to make when coding games live.,"Our Rugbycology application captures key team performance data in real-time and in chronological form to map an entire game based on attack possessions. Each data point recorded is used to create a wide range of team performance metrics that coaches use to better understand strengths and weaknesses. Rugbycology metrics essentially allow for clubs and schools with less resources to access a high level of analytical insight. This levels the playing field for less-resourced teams and increases the base amount of data generated in the sport.

To facilitate the capture of this data in real time, we are interested in an app that uses voice recognition to remove the reliance on manual input from the user. Rather than a generic recognition system as used for dictation, we seek a solution targeted to the specific terms that are relevant to our context (such as ""scrum"", ""ruck"", team names, etc.). Because of this narrower focus, we anticipate that a highly accurate system can be developed.

Together with Brendon and Dimitri, the students will capture all the requirements for the app and design its overall architecture. They will then be responsible for selecting the most appropriate tech stack, and for implementing the app.","Manual data entry model and user interface have been released October 2023.

Our Mission

To re-define the perception of ageing from a state of loneliness and decline, to a period of connection,  opportunities and growth.

We aim to build Australia's largest over 60 online social community, to encourage social connection, share knowledge and fun experiences, provide deals and discounts, opportunities to travel, work, create wealth, maintain health and wellbeing, and provide lifestyle and living options.

We build our community by collaboration with local government, organisations such as U3A and COTA, commercial entities, seniors social groups, and our team of 60 Plus Influencers.

Our Motto

The  60 Plus Playground, with its motto â€œTime to Playâ€? strives to harness the sense of play and creativity whilst living your best life in senior years.

We aim to build a 60 Plus Playground in every community in Australia.


â€?Play is the only way, the highest intelligence of human kind can unfoldâ€? - Joseph Chilton Pearce

","60 Plus Playground HUB - App

Phase 1 - Our first journey and foundations (Completed):

We have launched the first phase of the app, setting up the strong structural and functional foundations. This includes the initial registration process, a social page for connections with our social media sites and designing four key elements of how the application will work, with these being Social, Travel, Deals and Retirement Living. These elements are linked to social directories, websites and API White Collar applications (with this section still evolving).

Our Main Project - Phase 2 / 60 Plus Playground HUB - App will include:

UI Content layouts work;
Customised API functionality;
Response to social network platforms;
video instructions; 
Exploring the possibility of AI applications;

UX Initial registration processes and collating data;
API and analytical support;
Final registration with apple and android, and SEO functionality.

This will be a challenging project but also extremely rewarding and amazing for your portfolio's. This includes additional support when needed from professionals, being a part of a larger team, and your contributions will not only be highly respected and appreciated, this includes being a part of our yearly social events where we will have the opportunity to introduce you to a network of highly respected organisations who partner with us, opening doors to opportunity.
And here is the kicker you will be helping to build one of the first 60 Plus Playground resouces that will help the 60 Plus Seniors moving into the future and the application will be marketed Australia and hopefully World-wide.

As a Gerontologist, I see many older people falling through the cracks of our health care system. Loneliness is a huge problem. Many suffer in silence and are forgotten.

Current Problem : The Commonwealth Home Support Program is underfunded. Many seniors are assessed and approved for services such as social support and transport, but find providers unable to deliver a service because they do not have the funding. On the same note, there are seniors who wait 8 months to 2yrs for a Home Care Package. Sadly, some even die waiting for support. 

Solution: Years ago, people in a community helped care for their elders. I still see the beauty of this type of cooperation when I visit country towns. 

In 2012, Carolyn Roberts set up the Carer Assist program in the Glass House Mountains. She brought her friends together to help Carers and Seniors with basic support, such as shopping, taking people to medical appointments, and spending time with those who were lonely. Their work was recognized at the Sunshine Coast Leadership Awards. The lesson learned from her valuable work was that many seniors want to help, but don't know where to go to lend a hand. 
","In 2023 Tanya worked with a Capstone team to develop a Care Assist App called Kindness Counts. The key features:
â€?Would allow seniors looking for assistance to post a job on the platform to connect with senior volunteers who registered to accept the job. 
â€?Those who register must meet compliance, i.e. police check. These documents could be uploaded and verified as part of the on-boarding process. 
â€?Those who accumulate a certain amount of volunteer hours will receive gift cards as a thank you. 

We would like a new Captone team this year to deliver phase 2 to extend and enhance the app in preparation for publishing in October during Seniors Month on the Sunshine Coast. The transition for the new team will be streamlined with the help of a team member from last year who now works for us on a consulting basis. 
","Delivery of prototype phase 2: Improved integration between the multi user functionality and backend database. 
Anaylsis and execution of improvements to the user interface/interaction design and user experience.

We are a family and people focused business and have a passion for empowering women in business. We have 9 children between us and run a very busy schedule. We are driven, goal focused, friendly, visual rather than analytical, and are not technically minded (which is why we may need guidance from time to time). We value communication, honesty and the opportunity to resolve issues as they arise. 
Kylie comes from a corporate and small business background and is at the top of her field as one of only 10 Extended DISC Master Trainers in Australia. Thereâ€™s nothing she wonâ€™t help you to do that she hasnâ€™t done herself â€?from leading teams of staff to refining sales strategies, uncovering human behaviours and motivations, and improving skills through training.   
Dr Anna Blackman has an outstanding academic background. Over the last two decades, Anna has extensively studied, taught and published in her areas of expertise - business coaching, human resources and business management, plus rural and regional leadership. Online teaching and learning, as part and parcel of modern university life, is also one of Annaâ€™s specialties.   
We pride ourselves on being partners people can trust to understand their organisationâ€™s needs and deliver a solution in a way that surprises, delights and produces real-world results. Our organisation brings together evidence-based research and business experience in start-ups and corporate environments.
We use science-backed tests and assessments to produce real data that forms the basis of our recommendations and insights.

We service all stages of an organisationâ€™s HR life cycle from recruitment, team and leadership development, organisational climate and culture analysis and improvement.
View more about us on our website - https://talentinsightsolutions.com/our-story/
We have years of experience in business, coaching and people to support us to develop a people focused data solution.  Kylie is only one of 10 Master Trainers of Extended DISC in Australia, we have the opportunity to use the API integration to obtain the individual behavioural data from the FinxS Extended DISC reporting tool.
Our vision is to create an App that is user friendly and interactive for Elite Athleteâ€™s, Coaches and Sporting Organisations to access data from an Athleteâ€™s sporting journey and be a supportive program for the athlete to access online learning, mindset strategies, interact real-time with coaches and manage personal development performance, reflections, strategies, goals, roadblocks and feedback.  
From our research, there is not yet a platform that integrates data from multiple sources for an athlete.  Imagine a place where an athlete can identify sport competences, store records, physicians and coaches can be invited to access this information creating a seamless athlete management portfolio for peak performance.    
An Athlete isnâ€™t born overnight and the data from their journey is key data throughout their life.  This data starts from a young age, it includes sports training, clubs, fitness, medical information (doctor, physio, psychologists).  This data is needed to support the athlete proactively and can be used along their journey to apply for scholarships, sponsorship, health and performance management.  
The individual data would be partnered with additional science backed information identified in our Sport Insight Assessment.  This data can be collated in the athlete's coaching program for a holistic coaching platform.  The program would be especially useful in identifying behavioural competences, traits, competitive and training index performance management, mapping performance skills, experience, performance data, injury/rehab data, coaching management for current and potential Olympic sportspeople and their coaches.  
The program has the added potential to be exciting and innovative for Australian athletes to give them an advantage on the world stage. 
This program could be time saving, enabling athletes to reach higher goals, faster and athleteâ€™s support network to gain key insights and communicate with other supporting associates within the athlete network to jointly map and manage an athleteâ€™s performance and development.  This evidence would become a base for future direction of training as well as identifying key ingredients to making champions. This is a world first and would be like the winged keel on Australia II in 1983 giving Australian athletes a distinct advantage. 
As our Sports Insights Assessment is the first of its kind in Australia, we are at the forefront of a game changing opportunity for athleteâ€™s in the wake of the Olympic Games.  This assessment is currently only being tested in Finland and America and there is not a platform that intuitively populates this data.  
To give you some insight into our Sport Insight Assessment, it includes an Athlete and Coach report. These reports provide data insights which identify and measure skill and behavioural competences to develop emotional intelligence, self-awareness and performance adjustments for consistent high-level performance in training and competition environments. The Athlete and Coach Insight reports are designed for elite or semi-professional athletes and their coaches. The reports provide real time data insights into key competences for the athlete to optimise results, performance, team culture and team communication.
Sport Insight Assessment Reports are intuitive, measuring 18 competences based on natural behavioural preferences and to an extent learned behaviours that create a competitive advantage for an athlete to reach the top. The assessment identifies those competences that an athlete should focus on to reach their goal.
The Sport Competences measure three key areas:
Sports Index - Measures the athletes competence strength level and awareness to gain efficiency and competitive advantage
Training Index - Measures the athletes competence strength level and awareness to gain efficiency and competitive advantage
Competitive Index - Measures how stong the athlete considers the competences relating to the competition enivronment
Athletic Success is 20% body and 80% mindset. Successful athletes focus on whole body success by developing and conditioning their body and mind to be champions. At the elite sports level athletic skill or talent, discipline and hard work are not enough to become the best
This would be a unique selling point and value add for our clients and consultants.

2.	Athlete Vault â€?Reposit for an individual's information.  Vault to keep records relating to the athlete.  This would be like a CV/Resume for current and future needs.  It would include information relating to - Injury, performance results, experience, achievements, courses completed, coach information/results, events attended (Similar to a MyHealth record database)
3.	Coach, Organisation, Club or School â€?manage athletes. 
The app would be programmed by an online website interface and connect individual's accounts.  A coach has the opportunity to assign the athlete with activities based on their results.
The app currently connects via API to FinxS and collects the Sports Competence results to show these in the individuals database.  There are 18 Sports Competences, and these will each have actionable items, content for the coach to assign to the athlete. 
There would be options for users to identify which type of profile is suitable for them.  Athlete or Coach, Organisation, Club or School.  This would then determine what user interface they would have access to.

If youâ€™re about to make a purchase on strata titled property you need someone in 
your corner, someone to look after your interests, to help identify risks, good and 
bad contracts, and potentially reduce your legal costs. We help the people we 
speak to in property purchases, to identify the roles and responsibilities of 
owners, managers, committees, and boards. We help them to be aware of the 
rules, budgets, insurance, levy collections and sinking funds that will affect them. 

Our site and document checks are designed so that clients can see if their contract sits within the 
parameters of a safe contract or if there are potentially important elements of 
their contract to check with their legal advisor. Our document check changes the situation for the buyer. It enables the purchaser to look at key areas within those 200+ pages of information and identify whether your building arrangement sits within the parameters of normal or acceptable terms. In doing so, we can help to provide peace of mind and guidance as to what to take to a legal advisor for further consideration, vastly decreasing expenses in assuring that strata contract works 
for the purchaser.
","We provide a 1-page report (and now hope to digitise this report with your help) based on guided self-analysis of a Strata Title Contract, with the 'client' entering the answers to 15 key questions and then getting feedback (based on the inputed data and relevance to an information/data range) helping them to identify positive and negative contract elements, providing contextual advice regarding their contract that they can take to their professional legal advisor for further 
information (with increased focus and reduced expense) to help them make high-value purchase decisions. 

Further to that key part of the project we have learning modules to build out (using Learnworlds, an LMS that integrates with the WordPress site) to guide people in identifying the roles and responsibilities of owners, managers, committees, and boards, with learning in how to identify risks, good vs bad contracts, rules, budgets, insurance, levy collections and sinking funds that will affect them.
 
The third aspect of the site is an advertising portal to showcase developers, marketing groups and other suppliers who present their ethically presented product (finance, building and pest inspections, etc.) to the client base after their product has been given the strata check stamp 
of approval. We're mostly set up, except for this significant limitation of form performance, which is crucial to the performance of the site.","The project deliverable is to create the interaction between the guided self-analysis of a Strata Title Contract, with the 'client' entering the answers to 15 key questions and then getting feedback based on the inputed data and relevance to an information/data range. The ability to move forward with the project is enhanced by the handover docs from the previous Capstone teams.

Back end and Database management",Web Development,WEDE,"IDUX, WEDE","The TGG mission is:
To partner with leaders to upgrade their mindset, upskill their leadership and uplift their teams, to create psychology safe and high performing teams! 

The TGG culture is built on:
â€¢The Core beliefs of:
oFelt â€?Our work is designed to connect with our clients, for us and them to create authentic rapport, and for us to build a relationship where we can talk in emotions and support leaders under pressure
oFocus - Our work is focused specifically on what our clients require, how they require it, and what we can do to help them to improve their leaders, their teams, and their emotional control
oFlow â€?Our work is designed to flow from one project to another, in a way that is seamless, adds value, and is in synchronicity with the creation of conscious control 

â€¢The Core Values of:
oEnergy â€?We show up prepared, and with purpose, poise, and passion
oEngagement â€?We listen to understand, and believe that all opinions count
oEnterprise Thinking â€?We support leaders to create safe and caring teams

This project will align with the TGG beliefs and values, as it will allow us to track, measure, and monitor leaders who are under pressure. And the project will inform how we can provide more support to those leaders who are leading through crisis events. We believe that the more information that we have, the better we can design leadership training and development programs giving leaders and their teams the best possible outcomes! We want to use technology to assist us with leadership training, and the subsequent leadership decision making.

A little about Anton, our director and whom the Capstone team would be working with:

Anton is an expert in the field of leadership under pressure, he is a best-selling author, and motivational speaker. Anton works with leaders through training, coaching and consulting to help them:

oCreate emotional, behavioural, and situational control
oGet connected with your team (through high quality communication)
oBe courageous as a leader, and be able to try, tell and trust

Anton nearly lost his life in a workplace accident and has turned that experience into something that others can learn from. He has since completed a Bachelor of Business in HR and a Bachelor of Science in Psychology and is doing his Master of Research, Organisational Leadership researching his relentless question: 'Why do leaders need to be calmer and more controlled, and how can they do that'?

","End goal: A web-based video styled personal surveying tool (survey) that measures user responses and collates survey data in an analysis tool (program) which is easy for clients to use (positive user experience) and provides our business with a saleable product that supports us to provide the best training for leaders under pressure. 

Bigger picture: To launch a new four-day program that follows the following format:

Day 1: Pressure scenario 1
Day 2: Leadership under Pressure Training 
Day 3: Leadership under Pressure Training 
Day 4: Pressure scenario 4

In short, we will be putting trainees into a pressure packed situation, measuring their baseline response patterns. Providing two days of training. Then, putting trainees into a second pressure packed situation and measuring their new skills and ability to better deal with the pressure. 

Where are we now: Phase 1 is complete, and we have the backend of our video styled personal survey tool, that asks questions, captures responses, and collates survey data in an analysis tool (program).  We have a copy of the source code files that we can provide you with as well. Currently high-pressure situational videos can be uploaded, and questions created to go with the videos as well as data collated, and reports created. Tools to measure stress response have also been included such as voice and eye movement. Currently the program has been set up to be hosted via a cloud-based site (AWS Amazon).

What next: We need your skills to further develop and refine the program, creating a fully operational frontend and refining the backend, ensuring it is functioning as it should (collating data and generating reports that can be used to measure and compare results). The program needs to provide a positive user experience/interface (very important as per our beliefs â€?Felt, Focus, Flow). A review of the backend including stress measurement tools (AI) and the program overall is welcomed as well as any recommendations of improvements we can implement whilst partnering with your team. We would like the program to potentially be hosted as a hidden page on our website rather than cloud-based however will be guided by your expertise.

Specialist Investigators Training (SIT) within the Queensland Police Service (QPS) is a dynamic team of highly experienced police investigators that facilitates the design and delivery of face-to-face specialist courses to police detectives at the QPS Academy. The core training courses delivered by SIT include: Child Protection & Youth Justice (CPYJ); Inteviewing Children and Recording Evidence (ICARE); and Investigating Sexual Assault, Corroborating and Understanding Relationship Evidence (ISACURE).   Currently, the delivery and evaluation of these courses courses, including course content, participant assessments, course evaluations, and overall engagement between participants and facilitators, are conducted across multiple platforms. Additionally, there is a desire to provide ongoing learning support and research updates through investigator forums available to all course particpants.  To enhance the evidencing of training and support application of training gains to operational practice, the SIT aims to partner with high-performing IT students to create an integrated platform/portal that provides a single destination for previous/current/future SIT course participants with which to engage. 
Purpose:

The SIT requires a new systems environment where courses can be electronically managed, participation and performance can be monitored and evaluated, and graduates can engage through an investigator forum. The SIT manager, facilitators and course participants should be able to operate all functions electronically (with varying levels of access accordingly) with progress easily through a user-defined dashboard. 
","This project has been envisaged as a two year project to run across more than one Capstone project term. This year's project is the second phase and will pick up from the previous team's work. There will be a full handover and technical specification report to ensure a smooth transition.
The project involves the development of a platform which can be viewed and operated on Windows desktop and Apple mobile devices with dashboards. This platform will be a standalone website that will not be integrated into other QPS IT systems. The platform should have full access to SIT staff to update/edit/design new content easily. 
 
The platform dashboards include the following:
â€?Chat forum for investigators by subject (i.e., child protection, youth justice, interviewing children, interviewing/investigating sexual offences) available to course attendees with capacity for networking/chat in a live environment to facilitate access to investigators across Queensland to resources, support and guidance from experienced colleagues (and previous course participants). This includes a secure chat channel with secure storage and capacity to share information, including videos/multimedia as required.
â€?Learning platform for each course so that:
o	Facilitators can upload pre-course/course/post-course materials, view real time attendance and progress, access all student records and milestones
o	Participants can access pre-course material, course material, learning activities and assessments. Additionally, participants can submit assessments through this platform and facilitators will have the capacity to grade each assessment and provide feedback. The QPS has access to a plagiarism checker (Turnitin? We will confirm) that should be integrated into the assessment portal.
o	SIT can disseminate/collect pre/post-course surveys (through Qualtrics platform link)
o	Video/multimedia can be uploaded with subtitle capability to accommodate for hearing impaired and for operational situations in which investigators require learning resources without audio
â€?Research tab where SIT researcher/course facilitators can upload new research articles, updates on legislation, and provide other updates to users
â€?Online shop with branded SIT merchandise for purchase via cart (no payment gateway required â€?just bank transfer)
â€?Video upload capability across site with talk to text/subtitles
â€?Digitalisation of SIT logo for use across site consistent with style guide and colour palette.","Features:
â€?Centralised database with storage (not integrated into QPS systems)
â€?Connects to a Windows desktop and Apple mobile environment
â€?All course material in centralised locations. As the student accesses material, it is populated under their unique identifier which will become their electronic work area.
â€?Storage of student records
â€?Collection and storage of milestone submissions including multimedia
â€?Ability to record electronic requests to attend courses
â€?Centralised collection of course attendees including the ability to record the progress of attendees through all stages of a course.

â€?Ability to monitor a studentâ€™s course progress including milestones achieved through a dashboard.
â€?Ability for facilitators to electronically received course work, mark in the environment and submit results to the student and centralised records.
â€?Ability for a facilitator to communicate directly with a student during a live training scenario such as an interview with talk text capability The record of the interview with facilitator interaction is to be stored under the studentâ€™s unique identifier on the database. Also recorded here will be facilitator feedback and general assessment comments.
â€?Off the shelf digital shop with SIT merchandise (with editing ability for site administrators/course facilitators)
â€?Creation of a unique virtual environment where specialist investigators may communicate in a secure environment. For example, Child Protection investigators in remote locations may have immediate electronic contact with experienced colleagues in other areas of the state
","This project is envisaged as a two year project to run across more than one Capstone project term. 
â€?12 hours per week as per the Capstone curriculum
â€?Work conducted in collaboration with other team members with no access or integration to QPS IT (i.e., stand alone)
â€?Two initial meetings (weeks 1 and 2) of 1 hour to discuss project scope with SIT project coordinator via Microsoft Teams
â€?Weekly online meetings of 15-20 minutes with SIT project coordinator via Microsoft Teams to review progress

We are now focusing on supporting apprentices to get business-ready across Australia. 

Miles Primrose, started working on commercial sites at the age of 23 in a project management role and founded BusinessSight in August 2003. BusinessSight runs the most compressive business program for Trades and Builders in Australia from start-ups to businesses operations in their tens of millions.

Miles has been an ongoing supporter of the youth in the building industry and is a member of NAWIC, AWCI, AIB and AWIC and was nominated for a Male Advocate of change for women in construction.

We all hear of builders going bust and mental health cases on the rise. Our objective of the Business Ready Trades Platform is to address that before it becomes an issue. 
The platform aims to:
â€?Invite them into a â€œFunâ€?virtual room
â€?Take baby steps with options like micro credentials 
â€?Build a community across Queensland
â€?Encourage them to make better business decisions sooner 
","THE GOAL FOR THIS PROJECT: Is to revolutionise the educational system in the building industry, one that will solve the problem (see below) before it starts; to do this we need to work together and create a WORLD CLASS virtual room, (STAGE 1) â€œThe Trader-Verseâ€?one that is Fun, Interactive, Inspirational, and Current. One that can easily be understood by all learning styles, it ensures everyone is equal, no matter who they are of where they are located.

THE PROBLEM: We all hear of builders, large and small going under, ones that has been in business for 5/10/15 years. The purpose of this project is to look at addressing the issue from the very start and setting up students who are towards the end of their apprenticeship  or have recently completed it and giving them an opportunity to be a â€œBusiness Ready Tradeâ€?BRT 

The next problem is when students are towards the end or have completed their Trade qualification, the last thing they want to do is more study, however when Sally has finished her apprenticeship and is now a fully qualified trade and she goes home, her neighbour asks if she can come over and fix the plumbing, while Sally could do that, in most cases a new trade like Sally would have zero business knowledge or structure, this is where things can start to go belly up, (Traditionally things like Cert 4 get left for years later) 

We need to develop an innovative, interactive, and comprehensive virtual learning platform specifically designed for individuals that are completing or have recently completed their trade qualification in the building industry. This platform will bring together peers in the industry and inspire them to undertake a journey to be a â€œBusiness Ready Tradeâ€?

Based on the number of features this project is expected to be a multi-phase project over more than one Capstone team.

THE JOURNEY; Imagine going to a website and entering some information including your student id to create a membership.

Welcome and Meet Old Mate : First Log In: Upon their first login they get greeted by â€œOld Mateâ€?Old mate shows them around the â€œTrader-Verseâ€?and takes them on walk around and they build an Avatar of themselves, learn tips and tricks to get the most out of your time with us, as they build their avatar, they end up with a box above their head, this shows, their name, post code, trade and points accumulated to date. 

Imagine walking into a virtual Colosseum you go to stand in the middle and as you look around you can see over 12 different doors to different rooms each of these rooms has a different purpose.
The Rooms proposed are:
1 The Hang Out Space 
2 Your Library 
3 Industry Fun Facts 
4 Business Quiz 
5 Diversity and Inclusion 
6 The Feedback Forum 
7 The Members Map 
8 The Success Stories 
9 The Discover My Profile 
10 The Resources Room 
11 Funding Room 
12 The Improve my Weekly Structure Room, 
and the final destination is 
13 The Business Ready Trade Room

Here is an example of a room 

Hang Out Space (Room) : An interactive area to socialise, meet others, and exchange ideas with fellow members, In here there will be a place to sit, get a coffee, play fuze ball, darts, each time they introduce themselves to another member they get points, each time they play a game with another member they get points.

Note: as they participate in different activities they collect points there is a stick and a banner above their head this shows their first name the post code what type of trade, and accumulative points, every time they get involved with our activity or meet a different number they get points, and this collectively adds up on the banner above their head the purpose of this is to create a little bit of competitiveness and to get them to interact with other people and try some of the activities.

Becomes a BRT (The Final Room)  : Explore the steps and guidance on becoming a ""Business Ready Trade"" â€œThis is moving into to Stage 2â€? in here they explore different accredited units that can do or 1 or many years and they are on their way to becoming a BRT 
","The successful development of the Business Ready Trades, Virtual Learning Platform hinges on assembling a team with the right mix of technical expertise , creative ability and a shared commitment to revolutionizing trade education.

In 2009 they created AusMumpreneur, an online community providing support for women starting home-based businesses after finding a need for this through their own experiences as founders with young children while both living in the small rural farming town of Innisfail, North Queensland.
Having a limited sized local market for their idea they created a national online platform for their business enabling them to reach new customers all over Australia. They have extensive experience in establishing, building and managing online communities and they have been holding online events, courses and webinars since 2009. Growing the AusMumpreneur brand through the use of strategic collaborations and partnerships, a comprehensive PR strategy and a consistent digital approach saw their brand grow from a small idea to a strong and loyal online ecosystem of over 150,000 Australian small business owners which gain and share advice and referrals, offer support, celebrate achievements, spark new partnerships and form creative collaborations.

In June 2016, they launched The Womenâ€™s Business School, after recognising a gap in the market and a need for dedicated online education and support for small business owners delivered in a time efficient and easy to access format. They were awarded Australiaâ€™s Best Incubator for women at the Women in Digital Awards held in Brisbane in 2018 as well as being finalists for the entrepreneurship award at the global Women in Tech Awards in Paris in May 2019 and won the QRRRWN (Queensland Regional, Rural and Remote Womenâ€™s Network) Small Business owner of the Year award in Goondiwindi in September 2019.
WBS Alumni are from all over Australia, including every capital city as well as regional, rural and remote locations. Their businesses represent a range of industries including products, manufacturing, tech, retail, online, tourism, health, food, agritech, and social enterprise.
The founders range in experience from women who have been in business for more than 30 years with turnovers of $15million a year, to designers exporting internationally, to tech start-ups, to those who are pre-launch and everything in between. This range of experience and expertise provides the perfect ecosystem for start-ups and small business owners in gaining and sharing advice, asking questions, giving feedback, celebrating achievements, offering support, gaining referrals, sparking new partnerships and forming strategic collaborations.

","QUT offers a Project Partner Agreement to our industry partners to manage the requirements around workplace health and safety, intellectual property, confidentiality, indemnity and insurance for work experience arrangements.

The Womens Business Collective will require each successful student to assign their individual intellectual property and execute a Student Confidentiality and IP (SCIP) agreement.  The Capstone team will primarily be working with  background IP as they extend the existing POC platform. The project work IP will need to be assigned so that future student teams or external IT consultants can continue development and create additional features.

The Womens Business Collective will provide a limited IP licence back to the team to allow students to share the project for assessment purposes and to include in their CV or portfolio.

QUT recommends you take steps to ensure you understand the terms of any document relating to IP before you sign, which may include obtaining independent legal advice. Refer to the Student Instructions PDF on Canvas under Learning Resources for further information about IP and Confidentiality."
