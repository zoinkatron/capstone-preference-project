This folder contains the code for the proof of concept web app using Google Appscript by Taine. n0074040
Loader.txt and SheetData need to be a ".gs" file in the appscript project, they  contain the correct code.
Should be as simple as copying to a new AppScript project.

To get it working, make sure you have made a new google sheet
 => go to the Extensions menu item
 => AppScript menu item

 - you also need to specify and match the column headers of the google sheet and what the code has named,
	probably like "Email" in the json/AJAX data
